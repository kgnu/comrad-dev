We ask that callers have NOT won anything from KGNU in the last 30 days and can make it to the show.<br /><br />

IF DOING A PHONE GIVEAWAY:<br/><br/>

Give the phone number of the studio you are broadcasting from, and tell listeners which caller you will be "taking" (2nd or 3rd works well). Record the winner's information by clicking on “ENTER/VIEW INFORMATION” below, entering the required info and then (VERY IMPORTANT) clicking "SAVE."<br/><br/>

Please spell/read back the winner's email address and phone number so we can contact them.<br/><br/>

IF YOU'D RATHER DO AN EMAIL GIVEAWAY:<br/><br/>

Tell listeners that if they want to enter to win, to send an email with the concert in the subject line to tickets@kgnu.org. The third person to email tickets@kgnu.org will win the tickets and will be notified by email.<br/><br/>

For *all* questions about tickets, please email tickets@kgnu.org<br /><br />
